Medical Billing 
30 POINT DEDUCTION IF SUBMITTED LATE OR NOT IN CORRECT FORMAT

A Person is admitted to Mass General Hospital (MGH) and afterwards has a medical bill. 
Use design patterns to write a program which models this experience, specifically:
1. Attach dynamic responsibilities to a Medical Bill object so it can be customized at run-time with specific patient medical expenses (e.g. MRI, XRAY etc.).
2. Specify new objects to create dynamically for miscellaneous expenses already modeled by Legacy classes (e.g. ToothPaste, Tylenol, etc.);
3. 20 POINTS: Complete the supplied Person class (partial code below) with Person demo() method to demonstrate your completed model (Driver will call Person.demo() method).
4. 40 POINTS: Using supplied MedicalProcedureAPI interface (code below), implement MRI and XRAY using appropriate design pattern;
5. 40 POINTS: Using the supplied ItemAPI (partial code below), design and implement ToothPaste and Tylenol using appropriate design pattern;
