# Medical-Billing
Use of JAVA design patterns to generate medical billing

A Person is admitted to Mass General Hospital (MGH) and afterwards has a medical bill. 
Use design patterns to write a program which models this experience, specifically:
1. Attach dynamic responsibilities to a Medical Bill object so it can be customized at run-time with specific patient medical expenses (e.g. MRI, XRAY etc.).
2. Specify new objects to create dynamically for miscellaneous expenses already modeled by Legacy classes (e.g. ToothPaste, Tylenol, etc.);
3. Complete the supplied Person class (partial code below) with Person demo() method to demonstrate your completed model (Driver will call Person.demo() method).
4. Using supplied MedicalProcedureAPI interface (code below), implement MRI and XRAY using appropriate design pattern;
5. Using the supplied ItemAPI (partial code below), design and implement ToothPaste and Tylenol using appropriate design pattern;
